# Minimalistic Ecommerce frontend project

## <a href="https://ecommerce-client.onrender.com/" target="blank">Go to Project!</a>

*Note: it might take a few seconds for the backend to spin up on first load, for this case too, i implemented a loading skeleton as a side feature*

* The projct was built as a test assignment using React, Typescript, GraphQL, Redux toolkit. The interaction with backend is implemented with RTK Query and Opus(lightweight GraphQL client similar to Apollo).
* According to the requirements of the task, all of the components are class based.
* As a mock-up i was provided the following [design](https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-Public?node-id=0%3A1).
